_Hyperplan_ is a high ball that I discovered by chance during a hike.
It is located near [St Nizier du Moucherotte](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Nizier-du-Moucherotte).

This line is in the middle of a ~8m high blank wall with barely enough holds to make the climb possible.

- RÃ©my Le Calloch realised the first ascent on May 21 2021.
- I made the first repetition on September 11 2021.

_Note: We are not entirely sure that we are the first ones, but I have found absolutely no information about this line._

We both climbed it top-rope as we did not have the necessary margin to try a bouldering style ascent.

## Grade

It is very hard to grade such a specific climb, especially on top-rope.
I would say that it is around 7a+/b boulder.
It is too short to be considered as a route (~8m, with ~15-20 moves).

## Precise location:

- Start from Nt Nizier as if you wanted to go the Moucherotte summit.
- After ~20-30 minutes of walk, a path will branch off and turn right, into the forest.\
The wall is just there.

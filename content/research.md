### Deep RL for Human-Robots interactions (Inria Grenoble Alpes)

I am currently working within the [Perception team](https://team.inria.fr/perception/) from [Inria Grenoble](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes).\
I am doing my PhD under the supervision of [Xavier Alameda-Pineda](http://xavirema.eu/), [Laurent Girin](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~laurent.girin/) and [Chris Reinke](https://www.scirei.net/).\
My PhD project is part of the european [SPRING project](https://spring-h2020.eu/).

### Compound Figure Separation (HES-SO Valais Wallis)



I worked under the supervision of Dr. Henning M√ºller and Dr. Manfredo Atzori (MedGIFT team) on a computer vision problem with medical applications.
The task is part of the european [ExaMode project](https://www.examode.eu/).

<!--TODO: add photo-->

My goal was to handle the segmentation of compound figures (figures involving multiple sub-figures) from medical publications.
To achieve this, I investigated deep learning state of the art models and adapted them to this problem.

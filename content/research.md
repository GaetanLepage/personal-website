### Compound Figure Separation (HES-SO Valais Wallis)



I worked under the supervision of Dr. Henning MÃ¼ller and Dr. Manfredo Atzori (MedGIFT team) on a computer vision problem with medical applications.
The task is part of the european [ExaMode project](https://www.examode.eu/).

<!--TODO: add photo-->

My goal was to handle the segmentation of compound figures (figures involving multiple sub-figures) from medical publications.
To achieve this, I investigated deep learning state of the art models and adapted them to this problem.
